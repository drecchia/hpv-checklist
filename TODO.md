TODO:
-----
Make maxSelectableItems work on multiple mode
virtualScroll
focus search-input
add loading animation
fireEvent on end of listing ( allowing user to remote load more data )
support remote search

BUGS:
-----
Remove item by id not working
Updating orginal item to disable do not reflect rendered elements, not event calling current refresh methods
Option Group still displays select. Group even on single mode.

WONT DO: [ leaved to user handle on callback ]
-------
remote list
Remove from list after click
